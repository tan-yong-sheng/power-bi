# Power BI projects

This is my repository to store and version control my Power BI projects.

The course I took for Power BI:
- Get Job Ready: Power BI Data Analytics for All Levels: https://codebasics.io/courses/bootcamp/1/power-bi-data-analysis-with-end-to-end-project/lecture/937

The dashboard hosting I used: https://novypro.com/

(Note: I used Git LFS to overcome the single file size limit: 100MB)
